The Weigelt Corporation has three branch plants with excess production capacity. 
Fortunately, the corporation has a new product ready to begin production, and all three 
plants have this capability, so some of the excess capacity can be used in this way. This 
product can be made in three sizes--large, medium, and small--that yield a net unit profit 
of $420, $360, and $300, respectively. Plants 1, 2, and 3 have the excess capacity to 
produce 750, 900, and 450 units per day of this product, respectively, regardless of the 
size or combination of sizes involved.
The amount of available in-process storage space also imposes a limitation on the 
production rates of the new product. Plants 1, 2, and 3 have 13,000, 12,000, and 5,000 
square feet, respectively, of in-process storage space available for a day's production of 
this product. Each unit of the large, medium, and small sizes produced per day requires 
20, 15, and 12 square feet, respectively.
Sales forecasts indicate that if available, 900, 1,200, and 750 units of the large, 
medium, and small sizes, respectively, would be sold per day.
At each plant, some employees will need to be laid off unless most of the plantâ€™s 
excess production capacity can be used to produce the new product. To avoid layoffs if 
possible, management has decided that the plants should use the same percentage of their 
excess capacity to produce the new product.
Management wishes to know how much of each of the sizes should be produced 
by each of the plants to maximize profit.

The Management wishes to know how much of each of the sizes should be produced 
by each of the plants to maximize profit.

Assume,

The number of large size units produces per day at Plant 1 $$ = P1_L$$
The number of medium size units produces per day at Plant 1 $$ = P1_M$$
The number of small size units produces per day at Plant 1 $$ = P1_S$$
The number of large size units produces per day at Plant 2 $$ = P2_L$$
The number of medium size units produces per day at Plant 2 $$ = P2_M$$
The number of small size units produces per day at Plant 2 $$ = P2_S$$
The number of large size units produces per day at Plant 3 $$ = P3_L$$
The number of medium size units produces per day at Plant 3 $$ = P3_M$$
The number of small size units produces per day at Plant 3 $$ = P3_S$$

(a) So the Decision Variables are $$ = P1_L,P1_M,P1_S,P2_L,P2_M,P2_S,P3_L,P3_M \hspace{.2cm} and \hspace{.2cm} P3_S$$

(b) Objective function is to maximize the profit.

 $$Max \hspace{.3cm} Z = 420P1_L+360P1_M+300P1_S+420P2_L+360P2_M+300P2_S+420P3_L+360P3_M+300P3_S $$
 
(c) Constraints:- 

Capacity constraint: $$ P1_L+P1_M+P1_S \le 750   $$
                     $$ P2_L+P2_M+P2_S \le 900   $$
                     $$ P3_L+P3_M+P3_S \le 450   $$

Storage Space Constraint: $$ 20P1_L+15P1_M+12P1_S \le 13000   $$
                          $$ 20P2_L+15P2_M+12P2_S \le 12000   $$
                          $$ 20P3_L+15P3_M+12P3_S \le 5000   $$

                  $$ P1_M+P2_M+P3_M \le 1200   $$
                  $$ P1_S+P2_S+P3_S \le 750   $$
            
Excess Capacity constraint:
  In this constraint, we need to check whether the same percentage of excess capacity is used to produce the new product at all three plants.
                  $$ P1_L+P1_M+P1_S/750 \hspace{.3cm} - \hspace{.3cm} P2_L+P2_M+P2_S/900 \hspace{.3cm} = \hspace{.3cm} 0  $$
                  $$ P2_L+P2_M+P2_S/900 \hspace{.3cm} - \hspace{.3cm} P3_L+P3_M+P3_S/450 \hspace{.3cm} = \hspace{.3cm} 0  $$
                  $$ P1_L+P1_M+P1_S/750 \hspace{.3cm} - \hspace{.3cm} P3_L+P3_M+P3_S/450 \hspace{.3cm} = \hspace{.3cm} 0  $$

Non-negativity of the Decision Variables: $$P1_L\ge 0, P1_M\ge 0, P1_S\ge 0, P2_L\ge 0, P2_M\ge 0, P2_S\ge 0, P3_L\ge 0, P3_M\ge 0, P3_S\ge 0   $$

(d) The full LP model of the given problem is as follows,

$$Max \hspace{.3cm} Z = 420P1_L+360P1_M+300P1_S+420P2_L+360P2_M+300P2_S+420P3_L+360P3_M+300P3_S $$

                  $$ P1_M+P2_M+P3_M \le 1200   $$
                  $$ P1_S+P2_S+P3_S \le 750   $$
            
Excess Capacity constraint:

                  $$ P1_L+P1_M+P1_S/750 \hspace{.3cm} - \hspace{.3cm} P2_L+P2_M+P2_S/900 \hspace{.3cm} = \hspace{.3cm} 0  $$
                  $$ P2_L+P2_M+P2_S/900 \hspace{.3cm} - \hspace{.3cm} P3_L+P3_M+P3_S/450 \hspace{.3cm} = \hspace{.3cm} 0  $$
